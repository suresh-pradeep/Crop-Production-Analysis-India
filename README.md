# Crop-Production-Analysis-India
A github repository for the project done in the course(CS661A) in the even semester of 2022-2023 in IIT Kanpur

## Project for Crop Data Visualisation
### Data
We have used the following datasets for our analysis
1. India's 1998-2017 crop production statistics by state and district showing annual production of more than fifty crops 
2. Rainfall statistics of India from 1998 to 2017, categorised by district, state and sub-division
3. India district-wise geojson (epsg:4326) created from India shape-file using QGIS software.
### Tasks
We have implemented the following tasks in our dashboard:
1. **Task 1:** To analyze crop production statistics across the nation (district-wise)  
2. **Task 2:** To analyze trends in crop production over the years
3. **Task 3:** To correlate rainfall pattern with crop production trends
### Execution commands

`pip install requirements.txt`\
Please unzip the file `merged.zip` to get `merged.csv` file before executing the script\
For executing the script and hosting the dashboard locally, use: \
